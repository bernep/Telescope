#### Description
Telescope is a website that manages projects, developers, and attendance for 
RCOS. We aim to replace the current system, 
[Observatory](https://github.com/rcos/observatory-server).
Key features include improved attendance tracking, user and project management,
and a comprehensive set of tools for mentors and coordinators. 

#### Technology:
Telescope's backend is written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and uses 
the [actix-web](https://actix.rs/) web framework to route and serve requests.
Telescope encrypts all traffic using SSL/TLS technology via 
[openssl](https://www.openssl.org/). The backend interfaces with a 
[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database using the 
[diesel](http://diesel.rs/) ORM and query building framework.

Telescope's frontend is built using the [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) 
templating engine and [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework.
